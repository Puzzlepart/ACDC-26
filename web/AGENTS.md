## Team Context

### Company
- **Crayon Consulting** - Microsoft365/SharePoint specialists
- Located in Norway (Oslo area)
- Tech-focused consulting firm

### Competition Theme
- Minecraft-themed company event
- "Arctic Cloud Developer Challenge"
- Mainly Microsoft Stack focus at event, but team is multi-tech/full-stack
- Computer/hacking culture references encouraged
- Year: 2026

### Team Member (Project Owner)
- Web developer, 18+ years experience, SharePoint/Full-Stack/Node/TypeScript
- Stack: TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, C/C++
- Interests: AI/LLMs, IoT, embedded systems, gaming, retro computing

## Technical Guidelines

### Preferred Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun > Deno > Node (Bun preferred for speed)
- **Framework**: React + Vite (most agent-friendly)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first, easy to modify)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion or CSS (keep performant)
- **Backend**: Hono for API if needed, otherwise static

### Code Style
- TypeScript preferred where it makes sense
- Clean, well-commented code
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive-first design
- Performance-conscious (fast load times)

### Deployment Targets
- Cloudflare Pages (preferred)
- Vercel (alternative)
- Should handle both domains: creepers.craycon.no and ccc.d0.si

## Content Guidelines

### Tone
- Professional but playful
- Geeky references encouraged (Minecraft, hacking culture, gaming)
- Not corporate-stiff - this is a fun competition team
- Tech-savvy audience

### Must-Have Sections
1. **Hero** - Logo, team name, tagline
2. **About** - Who we are, what CCC means
3. **Team Roster** - Member cards/list (placeholder for now)
4. **Stats/Achievements** - Fun Minecraft/hacking themed badges
5. **Footer** - Links, Crayon Consulting attribution

### Nice-to-Have Features
- ASCII art easter eggs
- Terminal/command-line aesthetic elements
- Minecraft block animations
- "Matrix rain" or pixel particle effects
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Konami code easter egg?
- Creeper "hiss" sound on certain interactions (optional)

## Design Principles

### DO:
- Use pixel/blocky elements reminiscent of Minecraft
- Include terminal/CLI aesthetic touches
- Make it fast and responsive
- Add subtle animations that enhance UX
- Keep the Creeper green prominent
- Reference both Minecraft AND hacker culture
- Make it look like an esports team page

### DON'T:
- Make it look like a corporate site
- Overdo animations (avoid being distracting)
- Use bright, eye-straining colors
- Ignore mobile users
- Forget accessibility basics
- Make it too "kiddy" - keep it cool/mature

## Assets

### Logo
- File: `logo.png` (provided)
- Features: CCC letters with creeper faces, diamond swords, shield badge
- Colors: Green, black, some yellow/orange accents
- Use prominently in hero section

### Inspiration References
- Chaos Computer Club aesthetic (ccc.de)
- Minecraft official site (minecraft.net)
- Esports team pages (Team Liquid, FaZe Clan style but Minecraft-themed)
- Retro terminal UIs (cool-retro-term, Hollywood hacking aesthetic)
- DEF CON / Black Hat conference sites

## Domain Info
- **Primary**: creepers.craycon.no
- **Alias**: ccc.d0.si
- Both should work identically

## Notes for AI Agents
- This is a FUN project - creativity encouraged!
- User is very technically capable - don't dumb things down
- User values clean, maintainable code over clever hacks
- User will customize content later - focus on structure and style
- Minecraft + hacker culture fusion is the key theme
- The CCC acronym is intentional and important (Chaos Computer Club homage)

## Future Enhancements (Maybe)
- Team member profiles with stats
- Blog/updates section
- Competition results/leaderboard
- Photo gallery
- Integration with Minecraft server stats (if applicable)
- Dark/light mode toggle (though dark is default aesthetic)
