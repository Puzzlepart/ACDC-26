# Sharing is Caring: The Comrade's Guide to Open Source

TL;DR: We open-sourced our entire codebase under WTFPL. We published the badge-sniper skill that tells competitors how to beat us. We built a better scoreboard than the official one and gave it to every team. We debugged other teams' Minecraft bots when they were stuck. If that's not sharing, nothing is.

At CrayCon Creepers, we believe in the collective good. We've built on the shoulders of giants, and now we're extending a hand to those who need it.

Open Source Under WTFPL

Our entire codebase lives at https://github.com/Puzzlepart/ACDC-26 under the WTFPL (Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License). No strings attached. No complicated attribution requirements. Just pure, unfiltered open source.

Want our Minecraft bot framework? Take it. Need our React + Vite + Tailwind setup? It's yours. Fancy the Cloudflare Workers deployment pipeline? Clone away.

LICENSE: https://github.com/Puzzlepart/ACDC-26/blob/main/LICENSE — Because good code deserves to be free.

The ACDC Badge Sniper Skill

We didn't just open source our application code—we shared the meta-strategy. The acdc-badge-sniper is a Claude Code skill that helps teams identify high-ROI badge targets, rank them by effort vs. reward, and generate time-boxed action plans.

It's a strategic planning tool that:
- Fetches live badge data from the ACDC API
- Analyzes your current stack and time constraints
- Produces ranked badge recommendations with evidence checklists
- Generates 60-minute action plans for maximum efficiency

Skill source: https://github.com/Puzzlepart/ACDC-26/blob/main/skills/acdc-badge-sniper/SKILL.md — Meta-gaming the competition, together.

We literally shared the playbook on how to win the competition. That's confidence. That's solidarity.

The Advanced Scoreboard

While the official stage scoreboard shows basic rankings, we built something better—and made it public for all teams to use: https://creepers.craycon.no/badges

Our scoreboard lets teams:
- Filter badges by status (missing, acquired, rejected)
- View detailed badge requirements and evidence
- Track their own progress without scrolling through leaderboards
- See what's left to claim with time running out

It's more functional than the official version. We didn't have to share it publicly—we could've kept it as an internal advantage. But that's not the comrade way.

Every team in ACDC can use it. Every team benefits. That's the power of building in public.

Helping the Collective

When neighboring teams hit Minecraft-related roadblocks, we didn't gate-keep. We debugged connection issues, explained Mineflayer pathfinding quirks, and shared bot profile configs.

Someone couldn't get their bot to authenticate? We walked them through the settings.js configuration and Microsoft account setup. Team struggling with inventory management? We shared our action library examples and explained the memory system.

Because a rising tide lifts all boats. And because explaining code to others makes our own implementation better.

The Spirit of Sharing

This badge isn't about checking boxes—it's about embodying open source values. We've taken from the community (Bootstrap, PrismarineJS, seventeen AI providers). Now we're giving back (code, skills, knowledge).

That's how engineering moves forward. Not through hoarding, but through sharing. Not through gatekeeping, but through teaching.

The Sharing is Caring badge is ours because we built in public, documented in detail, and helped our comrades when they needed it.
