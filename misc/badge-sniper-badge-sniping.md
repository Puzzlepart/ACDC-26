 Badge Sniper: "Sharing the Sniper" Strategy

  DIRECT-HIT BADGES (High Confidence)

  1. Sharing is Caring (Soft Badges, 10 pts) ✅ LOCK IT IN

  Requirement: "Code, dataset or Api is made available for other teams."
  Why it fits: You're literally sharing a working tool with all teams
  Evidence:
  - Post skill to shared repo or distribute to teams
  - Screenshot/proof of other teams accessing it
  - Quick README showing how to use it

  Pitch: "We built an AI agent skill that helps teams strategize badges—and gave it to everyone. Here's proof of [Team X] using it."

  ---
  2. Community Champion (Soft Badges, 10 pts) ✅ NATURAL FIT

  Requirement: "Goes out of their way to help and encourage other teams."
  Why it fits: Sharing a competitive advantage tool is peak community spirit
  Evidence:
  - Photo/screenshot of you helping another team set it up
  - Testimonial from another team
  - Slack/Teams message showing you offering help

  Pitch: "We spent hours building a badge strategy tool, then walked around teaching other teams how to use it. Competition is fun, but community is better."

  3. Hipster (Low Code, 10 pts) ✅ BLEEDING EDGE

  Requirement: "Show use of the hippest coolest tech."
  Why it fits: Claude Code agent skills are brand new (2024-2025 release). AI agents as dev tools are peak hype.
  Evidence:
  - Show the skill running in Claude Code CLI
  - Highlight "agentic" behavior (fetches data, reasons, plans)
  - Mention it works across Claude Code, VS Code Copilot, ChatGPT

  Pitch: "We built an AI agent that reads live hackathon data and generates personalized badge strategies. This is how developers will work in 2025."

  STRONG CANDIDATES (Medium Confidence)

  4. Dataminer (Low Code, 10 pts) 🎯 SOLID

  Requirement: "Uses external data to add business-value to existing data."
  Why it fits: The skill fetches blob storage data (teams, badges, claims) and synthesizes strategic recommendations
  Evidence:
  - Show the blob URLs being fetched
  - Demonstrate raw data → actionable insight transformation
  - Architecture diagram: blob → agent → strategy

  Pitch: "Our agent mines live hackathon data from blob storage and transforms raw JSON into ranked badge targets with evidence checklists."

  5. Power User Love (Low Code, 10 pts) 🎯 ARGUABLE

  Requirement: "Show a good example of how to use your preferred low-code platform combined with pro code customization."
  Why it fits: Claude Code skills are declarative (YAML + markdown = low-code) but leverage powerful AI (pro behavior)
  Evidence:
  - Show the simple config.yml and SKILL.md files
  - Contrast with the sophisticated agent output
  - "Low code definition, pro-code execution"

  Pitch: "Two small files—a YAML config and markdown prompt—power an AI agent that analyzes 39 badges across 13 teams. That's low-code with pro-code punch."

  ---
  6. Plug N' Play (Low Code, 10 pts) 🎯 MULTIPLE PLATFORMS

  Requirement: "Create an app/plugin for a Microsoft Product (Teams, SharePoint, Dynamics, Office 365, VS Code, etc.)"
  Why it fits: The skill has VS Code Copilot instructions (copilot-instructions.md)
  Evidence:
  - Demo in VS Code with Copilot extension
  - Show the copilot-instructions.md file
  - Screenshot of skill working in VS Code

  Pitch: "Our badge sniper works as a VS Code Copilot extension—integrated right where developers already work."

  STRETCH TARGETS

  7. Show And Tell (Low Code, 10 pts)

  Requirement: "Got a great, well thought idea with some cool sketches?"
  Why: The strategy outputs are basically "sketches" of badge pursuit plans

  8. Thieving Bastards (Soft Badges, 10 pts)

  Requirement: "Uses several third-party solutions in the delivery."
  Why: Uses Claude AI, Azure Blob Storage, potentially multiple platforms

  NEXT STEPS TO MAXIMIZE

  1. Package for sharing — Create a simple install script or zip
  2. Walk the floor — Physically help 2-3 teams install it (Community Champion evidence)
  3. Document the tech — Quick architecture slide for Hipster/Dataminer
  4. Demo in VS Code — Record 30-sec clip for Plug N' Play claim
  5. File claims together — Submit Sharing is Caring + Community Champion as a pair
