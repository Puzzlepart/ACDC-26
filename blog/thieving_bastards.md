# Thieving Bastards? You Better Believe It, Comrade
TL;DR: We stole everything. Seventeen AI providers, Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome, fifty open-source libraries, three cloud platforms. Zero reinvented wheels. Maximum strategic theft.

We don't rebuild the wheel. We steal the best wheels already invented, bolt them onto our Soviet production machine, and get back to building features that matter.

Seventeen AI providers powering our Minecraft bots. OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek. Why pick one when you can leverage them all? The entire PrismarineJS suite handling pathfinding, combat, and 3D rendering. Fifteen specialized libraries doing the heavy lifting.

The CCCP Factory Portal? Bootstrap 5 for the responsive grid, components, and utilities. Font Awesome 6 giving us 10,000+ icons out of the box. React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind. Cloudflare for hosting, AWS for storage, Docker for containers. Power Platform, Dataverse, Microsoft Graph holding it together.

Eighty-plus dependencies. Why write custom CSS for modals when Bootstrap solved it? Why draw icons when Font Awesome ships production-ready SVGs? Why build authentication when Prismarine handles it?

The result: faster development, smaller bundles, and a UI that works everywhere. We focus energy on the business problem—automated resource management, real-time dashboards, intelligent harvesting agents—not on rebuilding grid systems or protocol handlers.

This is smart engineering. Use what exists. Steal relentlessly. The Thieving Bastards badge is ours.
